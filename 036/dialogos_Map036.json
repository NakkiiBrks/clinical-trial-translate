  "1": "I wanna sleep in here.",
  "2": "Oh.",
  "3": "Of course. Let me gather my things and I'll get out ofâ€”",
  "4": "No. Stay right there.",
  "5": "Don't go.",
  "6": "Don't move.",
  "7": "Okay.",
  "8": "...Nn...",
  "9": "Good morning.",
  "10": "Good morning.",
  "11": "I guess I moved a little bit in my sleep. Sorry.",
  "12": "No problem.",
  "13": "You're really warm.",
  "14": "With a resting temperature like yours, I'm not surprised you're cold.",
  "15": "But kicking the sheets off probably doesn't help, either.",
  "16": "I know. Especially my hands and feet get like ice.",
  "17": "They really do.",
  "18": "Hah. Sorry.",
  "19": "Just shove me away next time. Okay?",
  "20": "I was instructed not to move.",
  "21": "Oh. I didn't mean literally!",
  "22": "\\|I did sleep really well, though.",
  "23": "Then there's nothing to be sorry for.",
  "24": "Are you hungry? You don't have to get up yet. I could bring you something.",
  "25": "No. I can do it. Let me do it.",
  "26": "Houseguests shouldn't have to cook their own food.",
  "27": "I like cooking. You don't. Seems pretty straightforward to me.",
  "28": "Especially if you'll do the dishes after.",
  "29": "Of course.",
  "30": "There you go. Easiest decision ever.",
  "31": "Sometimes I don't cook at home just 'cause it sucks doing dishes at my job and then doing more at home.",
  "32": "What do you do instead, then?",
  "33": "Not eat.",
  "34": "That's not acceptable.",
  "35": "Well, or I eat, like, snacks or something.",
  "36": "I wanna feed other people good food.",
  "37": "That's very generous of you.",
  "38": "Not really. It's just easier and more fun to cook when it's not for yourself.",
  "39": "And that is something a generous person would say.",
  "40": "I'm not just saying it! It's true.",
  "41": "You are proving my point here.",
  "42": "Let's do it, then. Shall we?",
  "43": "Yeah."
