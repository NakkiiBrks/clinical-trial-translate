  "1": "What is with this creepy ass hallway?",
  "2": "I know...",
  "3": "Why is the lighting so dim??",
  "4": "The sconces just aren’t very powerful...",
  "5": "I guess this is the taxidermy you were referring to.",
  "6": "It's a Jenny Haniver, isn't it?",
  "7": "Yes. I could cover it or move it, if you want.",
  "8": "No, it's okay.",
  "9": "It's a little creepy, but if you like it...",
  "10": "I first saw a Jenny Haniver in a museum when I was nine.",
  "11": "I was petrified. I couldn’t even believe it was real.",
  "12": "It was like something straight out of a nightmare.",
  "13": "I refused to pass through the room it was displayed in.",
  "14": "I was usually an agreeable child, so this offended my mother greatly.",
  "15": "She would cite my behavior as the reason for her overdosing on painkillers later that evening.",
  "16": "Woah.",
  "17": "I mean, sounds like projection to me.",
  "18": "She was raising three small children by herself and pregnant again at the time.",
  "19": "It's not difficult to push someone over the edge when they're constantly teetering there.",
  "20": "But I developed a real phobia of this thing. It haunted me for years.",
  "21": "I thought it cursed me into trying to get my mother killed.",
  "22": "I don’t like being irrational. So I got one, and I keep it somewhere I have to see it every day.",
  "23": "Kinda like doing your own exposure therapy.",
  "24": "In the past, yes. That was the idea. I've made progress with both of my phobias.",
  "25": "As I get older, I feel giving in to the compulsion to own one may have just been yet another irrational decision.",
  "26": "So you keep it around now, like, what, out of spite?",
  "27": "Maybe. Here's the thing.",
  "28": "I’m not scared of the manta ray, which is what this actually is.",
  "29": "I’m not scared of the person who salted and carved its corpse.",
  "30": "I was scared initially, but punishment for my fear was what created a complex.",
  "31": "I think I know what you're saying.",
  "32": "You don’t have to keep stuff if it’s just bothering you, though.",
  "33": "I am not afraid of it now. It cannot hurt me.",
  "34": "It is the people I care about who can hurt me. Those sorts of social phobias are much harder to overcome.",
  "35": "Besides, I prefer this rendition of an angel to the way my birth religion does it.",
  "36": "If angels existed, they probably wouldn't look like men and women in white robes.",
  "37": "Yeah. At least, I hope so.",
  "38": "Like, you wanna be stuck in this body for eternity? Really?",
  "39": "They should hold forms the average human struggles to comprehend.",
  "40": "They should strike fear into the hearts of the close-minded.",
  "41": "They should inspire awe in those who can appreciate them as they are.",
  "42": "Yeah. Yeah. Ethereal, or horrifying, or both.",
  "43": "...",
  "44": "What's your other phobia?",
  "45": "...\\|\\|Spiders.",
  "46": "Aw, I love spiders.",
  "47": "They get a bad rap. Totally unwarranted.",
  "48": "You're right, and I know it, and I'm trying.",
  "49": "We have things in common. The brown recluse spider, for example.",
  "50": "Being so reclusive your whole genus is named for it is something I can relate to.",
  "51": "Yeah. That's like me with the \"confused beetle.\"",
  "52": "I have very generously allowed a spider to reside in my garage. You may have seen it.",
  "53": "...",
  "54": "Want me to relocate her for you?",
  "55": "Please. Please do.",
  "56": "I don't wanna walk closer to that thing if I don't have to, honestly.",
  "57": "There just hasn't been much reason to decorate this hallway. No one but me ever sees it.",
  "58": "...\\|Lee.",
